	Casalib
	Revision 348
	http://svn.as3.casalib.org/releases/latest/code/

Note
	For targets other than Flash, casahx needs nme, neash and canvas-nme. To compile test.hxml, remember to modify the path to canvas-nme and the path to your local test server first.

	All the codes in the repo is maintained to be already tested and is consistant on ALL haxe targets, except:
	-NumberUtil.isNumber(), due to inconsistence of Std.parseFloat between targets, some weired expression may fail on some platform. But normal integer/float is ok and consistant(Please check List of test case in test.TestUtil.testNumberUtil()).
	-LocationUtil is not avalible on PHP. Assume JS is running in the web. Assume C++/Neko is not in the web.
	
	There are some functions different from the original casalib:
	-added UInt (org.casalib.core) : Used internally to make it usable in non-Flash targets.
	-ArrayUtil
		added indexOf:
			Same as AS3's Array.
		added lastIndexOf: 
			Same as AS3's Array.
		added filter: 
			Same as AS3's Array.
		added sortOn	: 
			Same as AS3's Array.
			Options are:
				ArrayUtil.SORT_CASEINSENSITIVE
				ArrayUtil.SORT_DESCENDING
				ArrayUtil.SORT_UNIQUESORT
				ArrayUtil.SORT_RETURNINDEXEDARRAY
				ArrayUtil.SORT_NUMERIC
			For fieldNames, it must be a Array. Even if you use only single field, you need to put it into an Array.
			When using SORT_RETURNINDEXEDARRAY and two elements are the same, instead of return 0, it returns [];
		added sortOnLite and indicesOfSorted:
			Same as sortOn but one is ingoring ArrayUtil.SORT_RETURNINDEXEDARRAY and one is always ArrayUtil.SORT_RETURNINDEXEDARRAY.
			Good thing is their returns are typed as inputArray and Array<Int>.
			Performance should be better than sortOn.
	-DateUtil
		added getTimezoneOffset : Same as AS3's Date. If date is not supplied, it use 1970-1-1, which gives best performance.
